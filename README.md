What is FIFA Ultimate Team?

FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) is a popular game mode within the FIFA video game franchise that allows players to build their own virtual football team by collecting and trading player cards. Each player card has its own set of attributes and can be used in matches against other players' teams. Player cards in FIFA Ultimate team can be obatined in a variety of ways such as through packs, the transfer market, rewards, and special events. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the best method may depend on the player's preferences, budget, or playing style. Each player card in the game has an overall rating, face card ratings (PAC, DRI, PAS, DEF, PHY, SHO) as well as in-game stats which are all meant to closely reflect their real life ability in matches. 





Business Problem

This project will mainly focus on players obtaining player cards through the transfer market and how player card prices are determined. Naturally we would believe that the higher the rating the higher the market price. However, there are many situations where this is not the case and the aim of this project is to explore which factors are most important when determing a players market price value and in doing so create a suitable machine learning  model using FIFA 23 Ultimate data to predict player card prices.
